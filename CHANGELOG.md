# Changelog

All notable changes to goinfer are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The forward-pass and quantization numerics are parity-gated against HuggingFace
and are the stable contract. The loader and architecture-descriptor surface is
pre-1.0 and may change as new model families and quant formats land.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`decoder.LoadGGUFBytes`** / **`tokenizer.LoadGGUFBytes`** — load a GGUF model
  and its tokenizer from an in-memory `[]byte`, touching no filesystem. The
  shared GGUF build core is reused by the path-based `Load` / `LoadGGUF` (both
  unchanged); EOS ids resolve from the GGUF's own metadata.

### Changed
- `demo/chat` (embed build) loads the baked-in model **from memory by default** —
  no temp file, so the single-file binary runs on a read-only / `FROM scratch`
  filesystem. `--model-tmp` / `GOINFER_MODEL_TMP=1` opts back into a temp-file +
  mmap load (lower peak RAM for large models; tmpfs caveat documented). Load
  progress prints to stderr.

## [v0.1.2] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **`demo/chat`** — "an entire LLM in one file": an interactive REPL with a
  zstd-`//go:embed`-ed Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-Instruct model baked into a static,
  no-cgo, cross-compiled binary (macOS / Linux / Windows × amd64/arm64).
  Defaults to the fast int8×int8 (W8A8) kernel; ships live prompt-tuning
  slash-commands and canned `/demo` prompts.

### Changed
- Requires `aikit ≥ v0.4.1`, which platform-guards the embed loader's mmap so the
  decoder (and the demo binary) cross-compiles to `windows/amd64`.

## [v0.1.1] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **`decoder`** — generic decoder-only forward pass with HuggingFace logit
  parity: Gemma 3, Qwen 2.5/3, Llama 2/3, Mistral, Mixtral, GPT-2, Mellum.
  Loads safetensors (single or sharded), GGUF, GPTQ, and AWQ checkpoints;
  f32/bf16/f16 plus int8 (weight-only and W8A8) and group-wise int4
  quantization; KV-cache; the standard samplers; and a pluggable matmul
  `Backend` (default pure-Go SIMD).
- **`tokenizer`** — byte-level BPE and SentencePiece byte-fallback tokenizers
  for the decoder LLMs, from `tokenizer.json` or a bare `.gguf`, id-exact
  against HuggingFace.
- **`constrain`** — constrained / structured decoding via a logit mask that
  forces output to satisfy a grammar; ships a streaming JSON grammar.
- **`gpu`** (opt-in submodule, `-tags gpu`) — WebGPU compute backend
  (Metal / Vulkan / DX12) that registers a resident-weight matmul into both
  the goinfer `decoder` and the aikit `encoder`. The cgo
  `github.com/cogentcore/webgpu` dependency is confined to this submodule;
  the default goinfer build is pure Go, no cgo.
- `demo/gemma` and `demo/gemma-web` — CLI and HTTP examples wiring tokenizer +
  decoder with optional sampling and JSON-constrained output.

### Notes
- goinfer is extracted from [`aikit`](https://github.com/townsendmerino/aikit)'s
  `decoder` / `tokenizer` / `constrain` packages so the LLM runtime can release
  on its own cadence, independent of aikit's stable retrieval core. It depends
  inward on `aikit/embed` + `aikit/linalg` (≥ v0.4.0, which promoted `linalg`
  to public and gave `encoder` a pluggable GPU `Backend`). The split is tracked
  in `aikit/docs/aikit-module-split-plan.md`. Pre-extraction history for these
  packages lives in the aikit repository.
