## How to use it

- **Claim before starting.** Move the item to `In flight` and put your box and the date on it.
  A claim is what stops the other box duplicating it.
- **Release on finish** — move to `Done` with the commit, or back to `Queued` with what you learned.
- **Never delete an item to tidy up.** Strike it with a reason, so "we decided not to" is
  distinguishable from "it sank".
- **Add the whole item, not a title.** Enough that whoever picks it up does not have to reconstruct
  the context from a transcript they may not have.

Boxes: `linux` (nvidia-rtx2070s, CUDA) · `mac` (Apple Silicon, Metal).

## In flight

**A2 (partial) · 26B documentation correction** — `linux`, 2026-08-12

The half that does NOT depend on A1 is done: the README instructed
`GOINFER_MOE_CACHE_SLOTS=48` and claimed it auto-caps to 38, when at the free VRAM the gates
observe it caps to **34 — which fails**. So the published instruction could produce an OOM on the
card it was measured on. Corrected to the highest measured-safe value (30), with the hit-rate curve
and an explicit reproducibility note on 16.98.

**Still blocked on A1:** publishing what the *corrected* cap delivers, and the leftover-VRAM column.
Neither exists until the accounting is measured — the model that was going to supply them was
refuted and reverted. Do not synthesise these from the current cap; it is the one under suspicion.

## Queued

Ordered roughly by priority within each group. Each item carries enough context to be picked up
cold. Where something is believed done but unconfirmed, it says so — **verify before striking**.

### A. Open investigation

**A1 · Why the 26B forward failed at 34 slots** — `linux`

The last inferred link is measured (384 MiB free does serve a 133.5 MiB forward on this card); the
accounting model that was going to explain the failure was refuted by the sweep and reverted.
**Current state: mechanism unexplained.**

Next measurement, specified and pre-registered: two `cuMemGetInfo` calls immediately either side of
`allocSlots`, **within one process**, at one slot count, compared against what `slotBytesPerLayer`
predicts for that exact configuration. Then a second slot count for the slope, which distinguishes
a fixed cost from a proportional one.

- **agree** → accounting is fine, the mechanism is elsewhere, candidate list reopens
- **disagree** → the gap is measured rather than modelled, and its shape falls out of the second point

Why within-process: the sweep recorded free *after* `allocSlots` and never before, so every
consumption figure derived from it assumes constant starting-free across separate process launches
— measured afterwards as varying ~300 MB against deltas of ~850 MB. That instrument can falsify a
2.5× error and cannot establish an 8% one.

Known and durable: driver quantum is **2 MiB** (not next-power-of-two — 5→6, 6→6, 9→10 MiB
measured); sub-quantum requests are pool-served but **not free**. Both asserted in
`cuda/allocgran_test.go` with their measurements.

**A2 · 26B documentation correction** — `linux`, downstream of A1

38 slots is unreachable with correct accounting. The published 16.98 tok/s was measured at a cap
that shouldn't have been granted — it worked with ~133 MB leftover, equal to the forward's demand
within measurement error. The README currently instructs `GOINFER_MOE_CACHE_SLOTS=48`.

When A1 resolves: publish what the corrected cap actually delivers, with a fourth column for
**leftover VRAM after `allocSlots`** — the figure that distinguishes a safe operating point from a
lucky one. Record 16.98 as **measured-but-unsafe rather than retracted**; the correction is a few
percent, not a repudiation.

The hit-rate curve is worth publishing alongside, since it explains the flag better than an
instruction does: **8 slots / 0% hit / ~5 tok/s · 16 / 57.3% / 11.33 · 38 / 81.6% / 16.98**. Note
that at the default of 8 the cache is **inert** — the routed set exactly fills it and nothing
survives to the next token.

Pre-registered prediction for 30 slots, to test the curve rather than assume it: **~74–78% hit
rate, ~15.0–15.8 tok/s**.

### B. Enforcement gaps — things that exist but aren't composed into a decision

**B1 · Env-var lint** — either box

`cc238c6` landed the `GINFER_`→`GOINFER_` rename (31 files, real work) and an env-var
classification as `docs/env-vars.md`. The classification is the expensive part and it's done. What's
missing is that it be **executable**.

Convert that table into the Go source of truth and have a lint read it — **do not write a second
registry beside the document**, which leaves two lists to drift apart. The lint fails on any
`os.Getenv` in the tree naming a variable absent from the registry.

Why it matters: 105 variables, exactly one of which anything has ever set. Six have no prefix at all
(`ZZBASE`, `GEMMA3_4B`, `G4_TRACE`, `NOISE_FLOOR_CKPT`, `ROUTER_CAPTURE_OUT`, `GIW_BIG`) and are
only findable *as a class* if something enumerates `os.Getenv` mechanically. A markdown table
maintained by intention drifts on the first variable someone adds.

**A3 · Make the launch OOM say what it is** — `linux`, NOT blocked on A1

The one failure that has resisted a day of investigation also produces the least informative
message: a raw `cuLaunchKernel: CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY` with nothing tying it to the cache
setting the user chose. The decline floor added in `7c91ccc` does not catch it — that fires below
`topK`, and this dies at 34 slots with `topK` of 8.

Two changes, both error handling rather than prediction, useful whatever A1 turns out to be:

1. **Name the kernel in the launch error.** One line. As a side effect it collapses much of A1's
   candidate space — a router or eviction kernel failing means something very different from the
   main expert GEMV failing, and right now the message does not distinguish them.
2. **Catch the launch OOM on the resident MoE path and reframe it**: name the configured slot
   count, say it is the likely cause, suggest lowering it. That converts a fatal driver error into
   an actionable decline — the pattern applied everywhere else this fortnight and conspicuously
   absent exactly where a day was spent.

Deliberately its own item rather than folded into A1, so the next investigation starts from a
message rather than a symptom.

**A5 · The corrected cap must be a SEARCH, not a division** — `linux`, design fixed in advance

When A1's fix lands, do not write it as a division with a correction term. Per-buffer 2 MiB
rounding makes the requirement a **step function of slot count**, and

    fit := int((free - marginBytes) / nLayers / perLayer)

cannot invert a step function — it is wrong precisely at the boundaries the failure lives on. A
division plus a fudge term reproduces the class A5 exists to close.

The requirement is monotone non-decreasing in n, so binary-search it:

    largest n such that
      nLayers × Σᵢ ceil(n·pᵢ / 2 MiB) × 2 MiB + marginBytes ≤ free

where pᵢ are the per-slot per-buffer byte strides (4 buffers per MoE layer).

Land it in ONE implementation — `allocSlots` calls `capSlots`, not a copy — with the gate pointed
at the shipping path and a mutation check. And correct, in the same change, wherever it was written
down that `slotcap_test.go` corroborates production sizing: it corroborates a parallel copy.

**A9 · Force `moePTX` to load BEFORE `allocSlots`, then re-run at 34** — `linux`, CONDITIONAL

**Trigger, restated.** The earlier threshold ("run only if free at the failing launch exceeds
~100 MiB") was written before the post-allocation headroom was known, and it now reads the wrong
way: the closed form predicts **198,836,224 B free after `allocSlots` at 34 slots**, so a reading
above 100 MiB is the *expected* case rather than a signal.

Read the **decrements, not the absolute value**:

- free after `allocSlots` → free at first launch — the gap is what `gmod` and the glue module cost.
- free at first launch → free at failing launch — the gap is what the successful launches cost.

Run A9 if either gap is large enough that the remaining headroom was spent by **module loading
rather than by the cache**. Skip A9, recording it as unnecessary, only if free after `allocSlots`
comes back far below 198,836,224 — which would mean the closed form is wrong and the cache took
more than predicted, a different finding.

Rationale: `fRoute` is the first kernel launched out of `moePTX` (`ropeKV` comes from `gmod`,
`fAttn` from the glue module), so a lazily-deferred module load is attributable to it exactly as a
first-launch would be. The cap is computed from a free-VRAM reading taken **before** that load. That
cost is invisible to before/after readings around `allocSlots`, and invisible to a between-slot-count
delta, because it does not scale with slots.

It is **additive with the rounding shortfall, not an alternative to it**: rounding eats into the
headroom the 384 MiB margin was sized to provide, and the module load then spends from what remains.

Experiment: force `moePTX` to load while free VRAM is still at its full ~3.8 GB, then re-run at 34
slots. Branches, pre-registered:

- `fRoute` launches after the forced load → module load was the mechanism; the fix shape is to size
  the cache **after** deferred fixed costs are paid, not before.
- `fRoute` still fails → module load excluded; candidate list reopens one entry shorter.
- the forced load itself fails → same finding, relocated to where it is visible. That is a result.

Read-only on the allocation path. The reordering is an **experiment first and a fix only after it
answers**.

**B0 · Repo-hygiene group must run what CI runs** — `linux`

CI went red on `staticcheck -tags cuda` (ST1005) and stayed red for three commits. The local
sequence — gofmt, go build, go test — and CI's check set are **different, and nothing declares the
relationship**, so they drift on the next change to either. Adding staticcheck to one person's
habits fixes the instance, not the class.

`gpu_gate.sh` group 5 has the identical gap: it runs `gofmt` and `go vet`, not `staticcheck`. The
gate is supposed to be what you run *instead of* remembering, and on this axis it is a subset of CI
without saying so — so running the gate would not have caught this either.

Fix: the repo-hygiene group runs what CI runs, **derived rather than duplicated** if practical, so
the next check CI gains does not reopen the gap.

**B5 · `RELEASING.md` must reference `QUEUE.md`** — either box

A file nothing reads is accurate today and inert the first week nobody opens it — the pattern this
queue was written to fix, applied to itself. A tag is the natural moment to review what is
outstanding, and it is a checkpoint that already happens. Cheap; do it before it is needed.

**B2 · Gate reconciliation — one entry point** — `linux`

Two mechanisms now exist for running the heavy tier: `gpu_gate.sh` group 2c (linux) and
`heavy_gate.sh` (`8fecfad`, mac).

Resolve to one: **`gpu_gate.sh` always declares the heavy group.** When not requested it emits a
counted skip with its reason and the verdict line carries it. Fast runs stay fast; no run silently
omits the tier. `heavy_gate.sh` becomes the implementation group 2c invokes, or it goes. Two files
is fine; two entry points isn't, because **the verdict has to come from one place**.

**B3 · Re-tier by cost** — `linux`

`GOINFER_HEAVY_TESTS` gates "needs a real model" and is used as "slow".
`TestSplitKV_bitIdentical` asserts bit-identity at 2048 context in 13 seconds behind two flags,
while 26B streaming runs 5m16s behind the same one.

Rule: **anything asserting a claim the README makes runs by default.** Census is gathered — 26
heavy-gated tests, with `TestSplitKV_bitIdentical`, `TestPrefillDivergenceRate` and
`TestArgmaxTieBreak` all backing published claims. Report the resulting tier membership so the
split is reviewable.

**B4 · Label or drop `stash@{0}`** — `linux`

"item2 unload-close fix + tests (wip)", `admin.go` +32. Almost certainly adds `Close()` to the
admin unload path — the change that converts a bounded leak into a use-after-free through the
`pick()`-to-`enter()` window. The safe version needs the drain, which is now implemented
(`588052b`), so this stash may simply be superseded. Either retitle it to say what it is, or drop
it. **An untitled WIP that looks ready is a trap.**

### C. Verification surfaces never exercised

**C1 · Drain fix — CUDA verification** — `linux`

Prompt already written. The admin-unload drain (`588052b`) is verified on Metal: unload freed
325 MB and reported `freed:true`, against 95 MB before. CUDA is the arm that can't run there, and
it's the backend where `Close` does the most — pinned host memory, mapped expert stacks, CUDA
graphs, then `ReleaseObjects` routed through the pinned executor via `reqCh`/`ackCh`. That teardown
meeting the drain is the untested interaction.

Four parts: VRAM reclaim across load/generate/unload/reload; the `preamblePark` regression test
under `-tags goinfer_testhooks` against CUDA; the straggler case if adapters are loadable; and
`--unload-drain-wait`'s 5s default under a real generation.

**C2 · Out-of-tree consumer audit against v0.11.0** — fresh session, **no repo access**

Prompt already written. More valuable now than when drafted, because the README has since acquired
many specific provenanced claims — deployment size, JIT timings, the depth curve, the configuration
sweep, request-body caps, unload semantics. The audit's Tier 1 is a claim-by-claim check from
outside, which is the only instrument that tests claim-discipline rule 7 ("a claim nobody can
reproduce from the public documents is not shipped") **from the position the rule is about**.

Must run blind: no clone, no source, no test suite. Carry the known-findings list so nothing is
rediscovered.

**C3 · Metal consumer window** — `mac`

The largest completely uncovered surface. Nothing has tested Metal from outside. Claims attached:
cgo-free with no Xcode, 73.6 tok/s, 0.96×/0.74× against Ollama-Metal, bit-identity within machine
and OS.

Sharpened by two things found since: `TestMetalSnapshotGolden` is a §4 gate that **cannot fail** (it
drives `Forward`/`ForwardArgmax`, which apply no embed scale, where production applies √hidden), and
the Metal device suite **doesn't run in GitHub CI at all** — the runner's paravirtual objc layer
SIGSEGVs inside purego. So Metal's entire device coverage is one manual box run, behind an
unfalsifiable gate.

The tautological-gate shape was found on CUDA today (four graph tests comparing graphs-on against
graphs-off without asserting graphs were admitted). **The same shape is plausibly live on Metal and
nothing would say so.**

**C4 · Soak testing** — either box

Nothing has run longer than minutes. The G1 memory-plateau finding rested on **75 seconds**. Memory
growth, KV cache reuse, session accumulation, fd leaks, thermal behaviour over hours are all
unobserved.

### D. Structural work, sequenced

**D1 · Trace tap and the launch-site coverage table** — `linux`, before D2's migration

For each of the 48 launch sites, two columns: which traces observed it, **and is it covered by any
asserting gate**. The trace proves the migration is faithful, not that the pre-migration mapping was
correct — so any site with no asserting gate carries its current mapping across unverified.
`moe_route` is one known member; enumerate the rest before migrating.

Run traces across sequential prefill, batched prefill, decode, an MoE model, and a partial-rotary
model.

**D2 · Launch-wrapper commit 1, then the migration** — `linux`

Design approved and fully specified. Positional parameters, one generated named type per
**(parameter name, C type)** — 13 names carry more than one C type, so name-only keying is
ambiguous. Buffers typed too. Returns `[]KernelArg` rather than launching, so `r.launch`'s sticky-
error accumulator stays intact and `prefill.go` and tests share the wrappers.

Extraction: `cuda/internal/gen` parsing `__global__ void NAME(params)`, comments stripped before
splitting, **hard-failing on any parameter outside the closed 9-type table — never skipping**.

aikit's two shipped GEMVs (`gemv_w4a8_fwd`, `gemv_w8a8_fwd`) are **derived, not transcribed** —
aikit ships `gemv_quant.cu` inside the module, resolvable via `go list -m`. The generated header
records aikit's module version; the diff test distinguishes "vendored, `.cu` legitimately absent →
counted skip" from "module dir resolves, file gone → loud failure".

Three gates: byte-compare regenerated against committed; coverage (every `.visible .entry` in
embedded PTX has a wrapper); and the PTX cross-check as a standing assertion, since `glue.ptx`
proved `.cu` and `.ptx` can diverge for months. Plus a second lint: **every generated wrapper is
called at least once from non-test code**, or is on an explicit test-only list — that closes
embedded-but-never-bound, the last uncovered member of the dead-code family.

Commit 1 changes no call sites and must be provably inert. Then migrate per file (`resident.go` 36,
`prefill.go` 11, testhooks 1) with a trace comparison at each step.

State the **641 → 0** figure in the commit message with its limit: zero counts cross-name
transpositions the type system prevents; passing a wrong *value* of the right kind still compiles.
The failure moves from an invisible positional slip to a legible mis-assertion at the call site.
**Do not write "eliminates transposition bugs".**

**D3 · The parked flag-pair** — `linux`, blocked on the freeze

`flag-pair-moe-cache` (`f6bbf7c`) carries `--moe-cache-experts` and `--moe-cache-slots` as CLI
flags. The `Options` fields and accessors touch `decoder/model.go` and `gguf.go`, which re-stales 19
families' `deps_hash`. `BRANCH-NOTE.md` records the pickup steps and the instruction that matters:
**run the goldens, do not refresh `deps_hash` to quiet the gate**.

Precedent exists for a goldens-gated refresh (`9e5f8fa`, where a metadata field addition re-staled
`weights.go` and the refresh ran 19 goldens). It was deliberately not spent on ergonomics.

### E. Release and claims

**E1 · v1.0 gate as written criteria** — `linux`

Decisions already taken: the parity backfill lands as **v0.12.0**, not v1.0. v1.0 gets its own gate
requiring parity coverage complete, the verification machinery sound, the loader and
architecture-descriptor surface **actually frozen** (the docs still say it may change), and a clean
out-of-tree audit against the release candidate.

Write that as a checklist so 1.0 is a decision against criteria rather than a feeling.

**E2 · The four per-family demotion judgments** — `linux`

`gpt2`, `granitemoehybrid`, `kimi_k2`, `nemotron_h` carry `validated_at: null` and are the same four
the `deps_hash` tripwire does not enforce — so 19/23 tracks both the backfill's progress and the
tripwire's coverage, and clearing it closes both.

Rule: every family claimed as supported at v1.0 has a current T3 row; families that can't get one go
experimental. **Honesty test per family — would you move it to experimental if no release were
pending?** Structural reasons qualify (no reference, fixture size, licence). "Unfinished" does not;
demoting unfinished work to clear a release hollows out the tier permanently.

**E3 · Freeze re-declaration** — `linux`

The `6edd1ca` freeze remains in force; tagging on top of it touches no core numerics and does not
lift it. But it needs re-declaring in a **live document** with scope, an explicit lift condition,
and who decides — rather than being reconstructed from a commit several tags back.

Enforced scope, now quantified: **19 of 23 families, `decoder/` surface only, zero GPU coverage.**
No `cuda/` file appears in the manifest at all.

And answer, rather than leave as an absence: **should `cuda/` files be in the parity manifest**, or
are the resident parity gates the right home for that guarantee with the manifest deliberately
CPU-only? Note that until B2/`gpu_gate.sh` ran the parity gates, GPU forward numerics had no
enforced signal in the release gate — not a staleness tripwire, not a parity assertion.

**E4 · `scripts/bench_compare.sh` — fix or retire** — `linux`, **status unconfirmed**

It measures goinfer with in-process Go benchmarks and never drives the peer, which is what made the
476/268 headline divide a kernel throughput by an end-to-end one. The README's false-rigor sentence
is gone, but **if the committed artifact still measures the two sides differently the gap reopens
the next time it runs.** Either make it produce a defensible server-to-server comparison, or remove
it and record that peer figures are measured manually with the procedure written down.

**E5 · Promo drafts** — Francis / Claude

Blocked on nothing now. They need **rebuilding, not editing**: written for v0.9.0, quoting withdrawn
476/268-era figures and the pre-fix peer table, carrying the 26B claim without its configuration,
and predating the `top_k` guidance and the §5 bit-identity correction. Claude holds them and will
rebuild against current numbers on request.

**E6 · aikit release** — `linux` or `mac`

**Deliberately not cut.** `be049df`'s FMA fix is already released (contained in `gpu/v0.25.0`
onward, and goinfer requires `gpu/v0.27.0`), and the unreleased diff is two test files plus
comment-only edits with byte-identical PTX. The rule recorded: **a release needs a reason a consumer
can receive**; test coverage, lint rules and CI are properties of the repository, not of the
artifact. The three gates and the first-ever GPU CI job ride with v1.0, where they are a line item
rather than the whole changelog.

Also open there, deliberately: branch protection is not enabled and `gpu-kernels` is advisory.
`scripts/gpu_gate.sh` plus a `RELEASING.md` gate ritual is the enforcement instead. Revisit at v1.0.

### F. Audit backlog

**F1 · §4 gates — five still open** — `linux`

G-03 closed today (`buildMatrix` env-pinning, via the `GOINFER_GEMMA4_RESIDENT` flip). Remaining:

- **G-01** — `TestResidentAdmission_matrix` tautological
- **G-02** — Metal snapshot golden drives `Forward`/`ForwardArgmax`, which apply no embed scale
- **G-04** — `metal/model.go:590`, `case "slots"` doesn't assign `r.residencyBufs`
- **G-05** — tokenizer/chat tests probe `/home/francis/models/...` with no committed fixture
- **G-06** — hardcoded developer-home paths across many files; no `GOINFER_MODELS_DIR`

G-06 is now partly subsumed by B1's registry, since the paths and the env surface are the same
problem seen twice.

**F2 · §2/§3 open criticals** — `linux`

Roughly eleven remain. The ones with the sharpest consequences:

- **C-08** — `cuda/resident.go:244-256`, `_ = gpu.Upload(...)` in `up32`/`upu32`/`upu16`;
  `r.setupErr` declared and read but never assigned, so a failed upload yields `ok=true` over
  zeroed weights
- **C-14** — CUDA argmax reduce has no index tie-break. Now has a funded reason: routing `top_k=1`
  to `ArgmaxEquivalent` recovers 13–18% and is blocked on it, and v0.10.3 made ascending-token-id a
  written contract the device side doesn't honour
- **C-05 / C-06** — gemma-4 stride assumption on snapshot restore, and unvalidated tensor shapes
  driving writes into config-sized scratch
- **C-21 / C-22** — embeddings has no batch cap and is un-queued; shutdown takes an unconditional
  lock after `Shutdown` and swallows a second signal
- **C-30 / C-31** — no mutex in the paging paths; `internal/giw/bundle.go:105` `make([]byte, u32)`
  with no file-size bound

§5 (23 major) and §6 (24 minor) have **never been verified at all** — presumed open pending a
targeted pass.

**F3 · G-01 class — confirm the sub-shapes landed** — `linux`, **status unconfirmed**

The class entry in `parity-coverage-policy.md` should carry **exercised but never triggered** —
`allocSlots` runs in every MoE test and caps in none of them, so a safety branch reads as fully
covered by every measure the project has. Recognition test: **does any test reach the branch**, not
just the function.

### G. New capability, scoped but not started

**G1 · LFM2.5-2.6B as an experimental family** — `linux`

Scoping prompt written. A fifth sequence-mixing family: interleaved gated short-convolution blocks
and GQA, `layer_types` controlling the pattern, `conv_L_cache` 3, LayerNorm QK-norm (not RMSNorm),
FFN dim computed rather than stated. The conv layers carry a rolling conv state instead of a KV
cache.

The estimate turns on two questions: whether Mamba-2's causal depthwise `conv1d` is factored out or
inlined, and whether the cache abstraction already carries mixed per-layer state types
(Granite-4.0-H and Nemotron-H suggest it may). Also unestablished: **whether LFM2.5 is
architecturally the same as LFM2** — the transformers docs cover only LFM2.

Blast radius matters: anything touching shared `decoder/` core re-stales all 19 enforced families.
Answer that before estimating.

**G2 · Items from the Go-for-AI tooling inventory** — either box

- **PGO** — absent from both repos. goinfer's default build is the pure-Go CPU path and this is a
  performance project; 2–7% is typical. Gate it on the parity goldens, since PGO changes inlining
  and inlining could shift Go's permitted FMA fusion.
- **govulncheck** — VERIFY FIRST: goinfer already runs it in CI and it is green (confirmed 2026-08-12), so this is stale for goinfer. aikit may still lack it; the entry should end up saying which rather than being struck entire. Originally: absent from both. For a project whose pitch is one static binary you `scp` and
  run offline, a reachability-filtered vulnerability statement is part of the deployment claim.
- **Fuzz corpora** — sixteen fuzz targets across the two repos, three committed corpus directories.
  A crasher found once and not committed is found again next year. The audit's hostile-input
  findings should each be seeds.
- ~~**Execution tracing**~~ — **DONE (2026-08-11).** `go tool trace` on `BenchmarkDecode` (0.5B,
  M1 Pro) resolved it: the "~8 ms host cost" / "71% `pthread_cond`" is an **idle-M sampling artifact**,
  not a recoverable cost — serial (zero fork/join) ties parallel in tok/s, the trace's real
  scheduler-wake tax is ~1%/token, and pprof's `pthread_cond` samples are parked idle workers between
  dispatches (a CPU profiler counts them, a wall-clock trace shows them idle). The right tool
  dissolved the question. Confirms the Phase-3b pool-null-result. Writeup: perf-campaign.md
  "Profiling coda". (Lesson: for park/wake questions use `-pprof=sync`/`-pprof=sched` from `trace`,
  not pprof CPU, which can't tell critical-path stall from an idle parked M.)
- **`go fix` modernizers** — one deterministic pass across ~20 adapters written over months,
  reviewed as a diff. **After the freeze**; it re-stales the manifest wholesale.

## Struck — decided against, kept so the decision is visible

- ~~**Default `top_k`**~~ — truncating the distribution changes which tokens are reachable, which is
  a silent substitution of something other than what was asked. Document it; do not default it.
- ~~**Change the global `--quant` default**~~ — CPU inverts the CUDA quant ordering, so a single
  global default cannot be right for both, and the evidence is one model on one box, never
  reproduced at 1.5B.
- ~~**Force cross-architecture float agreement**~~ — explicit `math.FMA` everywhere is a software
  fallback on amd64 that costs the SIMD performance the CPU backend exists for. Scoped in the policy
  instead.
- ~~**Slab restructure for expert slots**~~ — the control produced the reverse of fragmentation's
  prediction: a fresh heap with ~10 large allocations had *worse* contiguity (32–64 MiB) than the
  slot-loaded heap (96–128 MiB) at the same free figure.
- ~~**aikit branch protection**~~ — required checks force PR-only merges, which is friction against
  a threat model aikit doesn't have. The gate ritual is the enforcement. Revisit at v1.0.

## Done

_(append with commit sha and date)_
