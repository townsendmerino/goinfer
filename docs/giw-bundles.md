# Prequantized weight bundles (`.giw`)

What a `.giw` bundle is, how to build one with `cmd/prequant`, and why the quant is fixed at
build time. Back to the [README](../README.md).

## Prequantized weight bundles (`.giw`)

Loading a GGUF quantizes its weights on every launch. A **`.giw` bundle** stores the
already-quantized resident weights alongside a metadata-only GGUF (the source truncated at
the tensor-data boundary, so it still carries the tokenizer). Loading one skips
dequant/requant entirely — the weights are aliased straight from the file image rather than
copied into a multi-GB heap.

Build one with `cmd/prequant`:

```bash
go run ./cmd/prequant -o model.giw ~/models/qwen2.5-coder-0.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-o PATH` | output bundle path (**required**) |
| `-quant` | quant baked into the bundle: `int8int8` (default), `int8`, or `int4` |
| `-embed-int4` | with `-quant int4`, store the token-embedding / LM-head table at int4 too instead of pinning it at int8 — roughly halves the head's per-token traffic on a big-vocab model |

The quant is **baked in at build time**: a bundle made with `-quant int8int8` is an int8int8
model, and `serve --quant` cannot change it afterwards. Build a separate bundle per quant you
intend to serve.

Then serve it like any other model:

```bash
./serve --model model.giw
```

`serve --stream-weights` also produces these on demand — a plain `.gguf` is transcoded to a
sidecar `.giw` cache on first use, so the one-time cost is paid once rather than per launch.
